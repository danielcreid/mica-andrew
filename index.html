                <blockquote>"...we had people so convinced that we were married that we just started dating."</blockquote>
            </div>

            <p>We met in the most old school way possible—by meeting at a bar. Maybe I should specify... We met at a place called Cosmos in June 2010. He was a cook and bartender and I was there as a customer. I just so happened to catch him when he had just got off work and we started talking. That night of hanging out with him, he asked me to join the trivia team that he played on.</p>

            <p>The longer we hung out, the closer we became as friends. One night after a game of trivia, we thought it would be funny to pull a prank on some of our friends and say that we were getting married on Labor Day (Still 2010) and see if anyone would fall for it. We went as far as to have a “marriage certificate” made and constantly wear rings and act like a married couple. Our plan worked and we had people so convinced that we were married that we just started dating. We have been together ever since. Now four year later we are getting married (for real this time).</p>

            <p>On May 4, 2014, we were watching Star Trek after an exhausting work day. It was late, sometime around 1 am, when I said that I was going to get some sleep before our annual Star Wars movie-a-thon.</p>

            <p>Andrew was looking at his phone and said, “Mica. Guess who is getting married?” I am aggravated at this point because everyone we knew was getting married left and right. I rolled my eyes and said, “Well, who is it now?” Andrew then got down on one knee and had me look at his phone. It was a picture of Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard with the word “Engage” underneath it. “Can it be us?” he said. The only thing I could say was, “Are you serious? Are you sure?” When I finally snapped out of it, I teared up and said yes.</p>
